# The Two Shadows of AI Risk | TMP464
**Your Shadow #2:
[] Efficiency (1)
[x] Human (2)**

---

## SHADOW DEFINITIONS

**Efficiency Shadow:** When people skip safety/quality steps to save time
*Examples: Sharing passwords, bypassing approval, no documentation, accepting hallucinated content*

**Human Shadow:** When AI replaces human judgment, learning, and connection  
*Examples: No skill development, lost mentorship, atrophied expertise, weakened relationships*

## 1. SHADOW HUNTING (5 min)
**List 5 shadow behaviors you've actually seen in your pattern:**

In this (MTM) program:
1. People use AI to complete case studies and don't actually read them

From internships/work:
2. People used AI to predict the yield on wafers based on previous data on specs

From news/cases:
3. Junior workers are being replaced in software jobs with AI
/textcircled{4. AI is being used as a therapist and a kid ended up committing suicide because of it}
5. Call centers are using AI to schedule doctors appointments and such, causing a loss of human connection for serious matters

**Circle your TOP shadow behavior to work with**

## 2. INTERVENTION DESIGN (15 min)
**For your TOP behavior, design three levels:**

### NUDGE (Make the right thing easier)
Tool or process change: Making therapists more widely available - create therapist call lines or make it less expensive or volunteer people to call
### NETWORK (Use social influence)  
Who to influence & how: Influence teenagers and college students to seek help if needed. De-stigmatize mental health problems and encourage friends to talk about problems they are having. Create more social groups that are inclusive and people from all backgrounds can seek out easily
### RED LINE (When to escalate)
Specific trigger for escalation: The second someone asks a therapy question to an AI, it should be flagged and people should be reached out to

## 3. CROSS-SHADOW CONSULTING (10 min)
**Find 2 people from the OTHER shadow**

Key insight from Person 1: Proprietary information (like case studies) going into AI- how do we guardrail that?

Key insight from Person 2: People don't get harsh consequences for AI use in school right now

How the shadows interact: Students need to have guardrails for how they use AI and what they put into AI. Researchers don't want their papers going into chatbots!

## 4. YOUR COMMITMENT (10 min)

**In my first PM job, I'll watch for:** [] Efficiency Shadow [x] Human Shadow

**Why this one:** I don't want people to lose skill and I want employees to continue growing.

**Before graduation, I will:** Talk to more people who are in the workforce about how they encourage skill

---

## REMEMBER
Every AI failure stems from these two shadows. Your edge as a new PM? You see both clearly and can design for human nature, not against it.
